# 🏠 Zameen.com Real Estate Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real estate listings data sourced from Zameen.com, an online real estate platform.
The goal is to understand how property prices vary with area size, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, and to identify the most influential factors affecting property valuation.

## 📊Dataset
The dataset contains residential property listings with information on pricing, location, area size, and structural features. It is used to study pricing behavior across different property categories and market segments.
